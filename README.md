# Basis-Task
An App to have Swipeable Cards to read content.

The App works on three Pillars -> Retrofit, Recycler View, StackLayout

The process is simple ->

1) Fetch data using Retrofit, then parse it.

2) Use Recycler View for viewing data.

3) Use StackLayout for the visual appeal.


The app has the following provisions:

1. Fetch the data and display it as swipeable cards.

2. Swipe the card to move to the next card.

3. Go back to the previous card. (By swiping also.)

4. Restart it from the beginning.

5. Track the progress of the cards (Say, the current card is #4 out of 10, any indicator mentioning the progress.)
